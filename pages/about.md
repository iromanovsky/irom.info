Hi, my name is Igor Romanovsky,

I'm a Systems Architect with hands-on IT experience since 2005, including roles at Microsoft and EPAM, delivering international flagship projects for Core Infrastructure since 2011, and specializing in Azure Cloud since 2015.

> I help customers by designing and implementing solutions for Core Infrastructure on Azure Cloud. 

To see my proven track record of international flagship projects, check my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iromanovsky/).

This site is a work in progress. I have plenty of topics to share, along with crafting a custom design theme.

I will post updates on LinkedIn, you are very welcome to connect if not yet.

Thank you for visiting, and stay tuned for exciting updates!
