Markdown became an industry standard for Docs as Code a long time ago. It is used on Azure DevOps, GitHub, MS Docs, and even on my humble blog. However, one thing has been bothering me for all that time: working with tables in Markdown when you need more complex formatting. On the cover picture, you can see how unfriendly it is. In this post, I will share which visual editors for Markdown can solve this issue.

While many of VS Code extensions, online and desktop Markdown editors claim visual editing capabilities (WYSIWYG), most of them turned to be just code editors with snippets and live preview.

ONly these 2 tools turned to have true visual editing fetures

- [Typora](https://typora.io), shareware with 15 day free trial, availle for Win, Mac, Win. Works really well for my needs.
- [MarkText](https://github.com/marktext/marktext), open source, available on same platforms, Works on Windows and looks like a clone of Typora, but much worse. I could not start it on ARM-based Mac

Anyway, this is how markdown table editing looks on Typora



If you know any tools which are better ad allow to achieve the same result, please let me know in the comments.
